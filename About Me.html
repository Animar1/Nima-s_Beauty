      <p> Anima Rimi is a 17 year old girl that was born on October 9 2004. She’s currently in the 12th grade and attends George Westinghouse High School and the Brooklyn STEAM Center as her CTE high school. She sees herself having a career in IT for Computer Information Systems. She has always been interested in the technology area; this started in elementary. Where she would help out with the technology, like laptop organization and battery life; in middle school she will have a similar role - like a computer monitor. At that time she was in an apprenticeship,Girls Who Code, in her after school program named Citizen Schools during 8th grade. The purpose of this internship was to collaborate in groups to develop an animation by coding. Over time, Anima saw that she enjoyed similar activities. Later on, she found herself going to a CTE high school, which allowed her to join the Brooklyn STEAM Center, and develop interest in Computer Science and IT. This is where it starts for her. As she continues in the STEAM Center, she hopes to get as much knowledge as possible to meet the standards for her future IT job in being a Computer Information System Manager. Anima wants to continue to earn more internships from the Brooklyn STEAM Center, like her recent one. In which she developed her own face recognition model, and a self driving car. She has worked towards her own success and will continue to, as she aspires to be in the IT area as her future career.
